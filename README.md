# ProjectsList

### Hello and Welcome!

This is the landing page for my Github Repository. I'm a Computer Science graduate from the University of Waterloo. Owing to the proprietary nature of the source code for a lot of my school (research) projects, GitHub is where I host my personal projects wherein I try to replicate my school projects using open-source technolgies and tinker with new frameworks and tools. 

I have included brief introductions as well as links to the GitHub repositories of all my projects. Feel free to navigate and leave feedback/questions via pull requests.
